# Catch the Star Game 
ECHO is on.
**Catch the Star** is a simple and fun Scratch game where the player controls a bowl and tries to catch falling stars to score points. The game also features a snake that appears randomly, and if it touches the bowl, the game ends.

## Features 
- **Falling Stars**: Stars fall from the top of the screen, and the player must move the bowl left or right to catch them. 
- **Scoring**: Each star caught by the bowl increases the score. 
- **Game Over**: If the snake touches the bowl, the game ends, and a "Game Over" message is displayed. 
- **Interactive Controls**: The bowl is controlled using the left and right arrow keys on the keyboard.

## How It Works 
The game uses Scratch's programming blocks to control the movement of the stars and the bowl. A custom block named `fallingObject` is used to manage the falling stars' behavior and speed. The game includes loops and conditionals to handle the falling logic and score updates.
